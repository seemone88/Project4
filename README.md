<h2>User Stories</h2>

User will have to log in first before they can access anything on the site.(so I can deploy it online and not go to jail, I will have accounts already made for our whole class)
Once the user logs there will be a display of popular movies already populated on the page that user may choose from, or user may search for a specific movie.
